      <h1>About The Dad Effect</h1>

      <p>
        Every father leaves a mark on their children. Sometimes it's a lesson taught at the
        kitchen table. Sometimes it's a sacrifice made in silence. Sometimes it echoes for
        seven hundred years.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The Dad Effect</strong> tells the stories of fathers — from legendary figures
        who shaped civilizations to the everyday heroes who show up, stay present, and do the
        quiet work of raising good humans.
      </p>

      <h2>Why These Stories Matter</h2>

      <p>
        In a world that often reduces fatherhood to punchlines and stereotypes, we believe the
        real stories deserve to be told. The warrior who taught his son to live. The firefighter
        who ran toward danger to come home to his kids. The dad who worked two jobs so his
        daughter could be the first in the family to go to college.
      </p>

      <p>
        These stories aren't just history — they're blueprints for what it means to be a father.
