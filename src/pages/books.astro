      <p class="tagline">The ultimate reading list for dads — from expecting fathers to seasoned veterans.</p>
      <p class="hero-desc">
        You're not going to read all these books. Probably not even half of them. And that's totally fine. 
        But when you're staring at your kid at 2 AM wondering if you're doing this whole dad thing right, 
        having one of these on your shelf might save your sanity.

      <h2>The Real Secret</h2>
      <p>
        These books are tools, not rulebooks. Take what works and leave the rest. 
        Your kids won't care if you've read all the best-selling parenting books. 
        They'll care that you love them. They'll care that you're there. They'll care that you try.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pick up one of these books. Or don't. The important part isn't the reading. 
        It's the doing. And you're already doing that just by being here.
