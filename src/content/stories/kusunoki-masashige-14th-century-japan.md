*Medieval Japan (1294–1336)*

In 1336, samurai warrior Kusunoki Masashige knew he was marching to his death.

Before his last battle, he knelt before his 10-year-old son Masatsura and gave him one final lesson.

What he said still echoes 700 years later. 👇

The Emperor ordered Masashige into a battle he couldn't win. He could have fled. He could have rebelled.

Instead, he obeyed — but first, he pulled his boy aside.

"When I am gone, the world will change. But your duty is to LIVE. Survive. Carry on what matters."

Masashige died at the Battle of Minatogawa. His last words: "Would that I had seven lives to give for my country."

His son Masatsura grew up to become one of Japan's greatest warriors — not because his father trained him to fight, but because he taught him WHY to fight. 🇯🇵

700 years later, Masashige's statue stands outside the Imperial Palace in Tokyo — one of the most photographed monuments in Japan.

A father's final lesson outlasted empires.
