*Present Day*

David Dennis runs into burning buildings for a living.

He's a firefighter and paramedic from Kentucky. Father of SEVEN — six girls and a boy.

In 2025, his daughter Nora wrote an essay about him. What she said brought a room of adults to tears. 👇

Nora wrote: "My father is not just a firefighter — he's the heart of our family. Every time the sirens blare, he runs toward danger. And even after the longest shifts, he's still there: helping with homework, coaching our games, letting us know he's proud of us."

That's a HERO dad. 🔥

David joked at the ceremony: "If you've ever tried to get seven kids out the door on time, you'd understand. Or deal with six daughters, each with strong opinions and LOTS of hair products…"

Then he got serious: "This award goes to them. They're the reason I try to be better every day." 🥺

He was named 2025 All-Star Dad by the National Father's Day Council.

No fame. No fortune. Just a man who saves lives at work AND at home.

That's the @DadEffect. 💪
