*Ancient Rome, 234–149 BC*

Marcus Porcius Cato — known to history as Cato the Elder — was one of the most powerful men in Rome. Senator, consul, military commander, and the kind of stubborn moralist who made enemies as easily as he made arguments. He's remembered for ending every single Senate speech, regardless of topic, with "Carthage must be destroyed." He was blunt, uncompromising, and more than a little intense.

He was also, by all ancient accounts, a remarkably hands-on father.

This was not normal. In wealthy Roman households, children were raised by slaves and tutors. A man of Cato's status had a household full of educated Greek servants whose entire job was to teach the children. That's how it was done. The father provided the name, the lineage, the money. Someone else did the actual raising.

Cato thought that was garbage.

He personally taught his son Marcus to read. He wrote out history lessons by hand, in large letters, so the boy could study at home. He taught him Roman law — not the sanitized version, but the real thing, the way he'd argue it in the Forum. He taught him how to throw a javelin, how to fight in armor, how to ride, and how to swim in rough, open water.

The swimming is worth pausing on. Cato didn't take his boy to a calm pool. He took him to rivers and rough currents because he believed that enduring physical discomfort was part of building character. The cold water, the exhaustion, the struggle against a current that doesn't care how important your father is — that was the curriculum.

But here's what separates Cato from a simple drill sergeant: the ancient biographer Plutarch notes that Cato considered the education of his son more sacred than his duties in the Senate. More sacred. A man who shaped the laws of an empire considered teaching a child to read more important than governing.

He wasn't trying to produce a miniature version of himself. He was trying to produce a man. Someone who could think clearly, act decisively, endure hardship, and understand the world he lived in — not because a tutor explained it, but because his father walked him through it.

There's a tenderness in the details that's easy to miss. Writing out those history lessons in large letters — that's not a warrior's task. That's a father sitting down at a table, thinking about how a child's eyes work, making the letters big enough for small hands to trace. It's the ancient Roman equivalent of sitting on the floor helping with homework.

Cato's son Marcus grew up to become a respected soldier and lawyer. He served with distinction in the Roman military and earned the respect of his peers. He didn't become as famous as his father — few could. But he became something arguably more important: a good man who could stand on his own.

And Cato kept teaching. Later in life, he married again and had a second son. He wrote *Libri ad Filium* — books dedicated to his son — covering agriculture, medicine, law, rhetoric, and military science. He literally wrote the textbook because he didn't trust anyone else to get it right.

Two thousand two hundred years later, the lesson is still fresh: the most powerful thing a father can give his child isn't money, status, connections, or even protection. It's his time. Undeleted, unoutsourced, uncompromised time.

Cato the Elder, censor of Rome, destroyer of Carthage, wrote out history lessons in big letters for a little boy.

That's the part worth remembering.
