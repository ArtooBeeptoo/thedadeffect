The first few weeks with a newborn are a blur. Mostly, it's a blur of exhaustion. Your baby sleeps a lot, but rarely when you want them to, and almost never for long stretches. Forget "sleeping like a baby" – that phrase was clearly coined by someone without children. Your job right now isn't to get them to sleep through the night (that's a battle for later), but to survive the chaotic, beautiful mess that is newborn sleep.

### Expect the Unexpected (and the Erratic)

Newborns don't have a concept of day and night. Their sleep patterns are completely erratic, a series of short naps interspersed with feeding and fussiness. They might sleep for 16-17 hours a day, but in 1-3 hour chunks. Embrace it. Trying to force a rigid schedule too early will only lead to frustration. Instead, focus on creating a consistent routine, even if the timings shift.

### Safe Sleep is Non-Negotiable

This is the most important rule. Every time your baby sleeps, remember: **"Back to sleep, every sleep."**
*   **On their back:** Always place your baby on their back to sleep, for naps and at night.
*   **Clear the crib:** No blankets, bumpers, stuffed animals, or loose bedding in the crib. A firm mattress and a fitted sheet are all you need.
*   **Separate but close:** Your baby should sleep in your room, but in their own crib, bassinet, or co-sleeper. Room-sharing is recommended for the first 6-12 months.

### The Power of the Dad Soothe

When your newborn is fussy and struggling to settle, you have tools at your disposal:
*   **Rock and Cuddle:** There's no such thing as "spoiling" a newborn. Hold them close, rock them gently, and let them feel your presence.
*   **Sing (badly, if necessary):** Your voice is calming, even if you're tone-deaf. Sing lullabies, hum, or just talk softly.
*   **Swaddle Up:** A snug swaddle can mimic the feeling of being in the womb, helping your baby feel secure. Just make sure to stop swaddling once your baby shows any signs of trying to roll over.

### Track and Adapt (with your Partner)

You and your partner are a team. Keep a loose track of when the baby sleeps, eats, and is awake. This isn't about rigid scheduling, but about identifying emerging patterns. You might notice that after a feed, your baby is usually ready for a short nap. Or that certain times of day are more prone to fussiness. Use these observations to adapt your routine and tag-team the sleep deprivation. If your partner just did a 3 AM feed, take the 6 AM one so she can get a solid block of sleep.

### Embrace the Daytime Dark

Help your newborn differentiate between day and night. During the day, keep things bright and noisy. Don't worry about tip-toeing around. At night, dim the lights, keep interactions quiet and minimal, and save the stimulating play for daytime.

You're in the trenches right now, and it's tough. But every day you're learning, adapting, and growing into the dad your baby needs. You got this. And eventually, they will sleep. Probably.
