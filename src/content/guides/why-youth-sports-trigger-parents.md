You signed your kid up for T-ball. Maybe soccer. Nothing serious — just something to do on Saturdays.

Nobody warned you that you'd be standing on a sideline six months later, heart pounding, palms sweating, wondering why you're *this* invested in whether a bunch of 8-year-olds can kick a ball in vaguely the right direction.

Welcome to the dirty secret of youth sports.

## The Thing Nobody Tells You

Dr. Jonathan Jenkins is a sports psychologist who works with the New England Patriots and the Boston Red Sox. He's seen elite athletes at the highest levels of competition. He's also a dad to a 7-year-old.

And he'll tell you straight: watching your own kid play is harder than any of it.

"When we signed our kid up for T-ball for the first time, no one gave us a brochure that said, 'Hey, this is going to bring up every insecurity you have ever had for your entire life while you watch these 8-year-olds play soccer pretty terribly on a Saturday morning,'" Jenkins said on a recent episode of Youth Inc. with Greg Olsen.

But that's exactly what happens.

It's not the club fees. It's not the early morning practices. It's not even the politics of playing time.

It's *you* — standing there with your coffee, feeling things you can't explain, about a game that supposedly doesn't matter.

## Why It Hits So Hard

So what's actually going on? Why does watching kids chase a ball around turn grown adults into emotional wrecks?

Jenkins has a simple answer: "This term you may not have heard of — it's called love."

That's it. That's the whole thing.

You love your kid so much that watching them attack a problem fills you with pride. And watching them struggle? That devastates you. You know their face. You can imagine exactly how they feel inside.

And here's the part that makes it even more complicated: most of us signed our kids up for sports we played ourselves. Basketball because you played basketball. Soccer because you played soccer.

Which means you're not just watching your kid — you're watching a version of yourself. Every win, every loss, every time they get left on the bench, it echoes something in your own history.

No wonder you can't keep it together.

## The Parents Who Have It Different

Jenkins points out something interesting: parents whose kids play sports they *never* played often have an easier time.

Why? Because they can't project themselves onto the field.

"If my son becomes an equestrian, and I've never really rode horses in that way before, now he becomes the expert in the house," Jenkins explains.

When your kid knows more about their sport than you do, something shifts. They have power. They have expertise. You're just there to support — not to relive, fix, or coach from the stands.

That's not a threat. That's a gift.

## Making Every Day Count

Jenkins' son has had seven surgeries in his seven and a half years. That kind of experience changes your perspective on everything — including sports.

"We don't know how many days we're going to have with our son," he said. "So we're really trying to do quality over quantity. Put as many moments in the moments as possible."

That's the reframe.

You're not at the game to watch your kid become a future pro. You're there because you get to *be there*. You get to watch them try hard at something, fall down, get back up, and figure it out.

The scoreboard doesn't matter. The moment does.

## What To Do With All These Feelings

So you're standing on the sideline, feeling too much about a game that shouldn't matter. What now?

A few things that might help:

- **Name it.** You're not crazy. You're just a parent who loves their kid. That's the whole explanation.
- **Zoom out.** This is one game in one season in what will hopefully be a very long life. The stakes are lower than your body thinks they are.
- **Let them own it.** The more your kid becomes the expert in their own sport, the less you need to carry.
- **Course correct fast.** If today's your last day with them (and you don't get to know that in advance), how do you want to show up? Fix it now, not later.

Youth sports aren't supposed to be easy for parents. They're supposed to crack you open and make you deal with stuff you thought you left behind in your own childhood.

But that's also kind of the point.
