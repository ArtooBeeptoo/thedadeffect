Here's a sentence that'll make every "I'm not your friend, I'm your dad" guy feel vindicated:

**Kids with strict parents report BETTER relationships with their parents. Not worse. Better.**

The 2025 IFS Survey of American Family Culture just dropped, and the results blow up the modern parenting internet's favorite assumption — that setting boundaries damages your relationship with your kids.

Turns out, it's the opposite.

## The Data That Changes Everything

The Institute for Family Studies surveyed American families and tracked eight common parenting rules against two metrics:
- How hard each rule is for parents to enforce
- How it affects the parent-child relationship (reported by BOTH parents and teenagers)

Here's what they found:

![IFS Survey: Stricter parenting is harder, but associated with better parent-child relationships](/images/ifs-strict-parenting-chart-2025.jpg)

The rules with the **biggest positive impact** on relationship quality:

1. **Strict bedtimes** (ages 2-14) — Highest positive effect
2. **Dedicated homework time** (ages 5-17) — Strong positive
3. **Required outside play time** (ages 2-14) — Strong positive
4. **Screen time limits** (ages 2-14) — Good positive
5. **Device dropoff time** (ages 4-17) — Good positive
6. **Restricting sleepovers** (ages 5-17) — Positive
7. **Strict curfew** (ages 10-17) — Positive

Every single rule showed a positive effect on relationship quality. Every. Single. One.

## The Counterintuitive Part

Here's what makes this research so powerful: it's not just parents saying "my rules work great."

**The teenagers themselves** reported better relationships with parents who enforced these boundaries.

Let that sink in. The kids who had strict bedtimes, screen limits, and homework rules didn't grow up resenting their parents. They grew up feeling closer to them.

## Why Structure Creates Connection

This isn't actually surprising if you think about it from the kid's perspective:

**Structure communicates care.** When you enforce a bedtime, you're saying "your sleep matters to me." When you limit screens, you're saying "your brain matters to me." When you require outside time, you're saying "your body matters to me."

Kids can smell bullshit. They know the difference between a parent who's checked out and a parent who's engaged enough to hold the line.

**Boundaries create safety.** Kids don't want infinite freedom. They want to know where the edges are. A world with no rules is terrifying. A world with clear expectations is navigable.

**Enforcement requires presence.** You can't enforce a bedtime if you're not there. You can't monitor screen time if you're not paying attention. Structure requires engagement — and kids feel that.

## The Harder Truth

Look at that chart again. Notice the orange bars.

Every rule that improves your relationship with your kids is also **harder for you to enforce**. There's no easy button here.

- Strict bedtimes mean you can't just let them stay up because you're tired of fighting.
- Homework time means sitting down with them, not retreating to your phone.
- Outside play means getting them off the couch even when they whine.
- Screen limits mean being the bad guy. Every. Single. Day.

The "cool dad" path is easier in the moment. Just let them do whatever they want. Avoid the conflict. Keep the peace.

But the data says you're not keeping anything. You're losing the relationship you think you're protecting.

## What This Means For You

If you've been second-guessing yourself every time you enforce a rule — stop.

If you've been worried that holding the line on bedtime is damaging your relationship — it's not.

If you've felt guilty about being the "strict one" while other parents let their kids run wild — don't.

**The research is clear: structure isn't cruelty. It's love in action.**

Your kids might not thank you today. They might stomp off to their room. They might say "you're the worst dad ever" when you take away the iPad.

But the data says they'll grow up feeling closer to you because of it, not despite it.

## The Practical Takeaways

Based on this research, here's what actually moves the needle:

**For ages 2-14:**
- Set and enforce consistent bedtimes
- Require daily outside play time
- Establish clear screen time limits

**For ages 4-17:**
- Create device dropoff times (phones out of bedrooms)
- Set expectations around homework
- Have clear rules about screen time

**For ages 10-17:**
- Maintain reasonable curfews
- Know where they are and who they're with
- Stay engaged even when they push back

## The Bottom Line

You're not ruining your relationship by being strict. You're building it.

The "mean dad" who enforces bedtime isn't creating resentment — he's creating connection.

The data is in. Structure wins.
