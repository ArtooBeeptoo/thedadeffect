She's packing her hospital bag with lavender oil, fuzzy socks, and three different nursing bras. You're thinking... do I even need a bag? Can't I just show up?

Technically, yes. But trust me, future dad: you're going to want a bag. You're going to be at the hospital for a while. You're going to be bored, uncomfortable, and possibly covered in bodily fluids. Having a few essentials will make the experience way less miserable.

## The Obvious Stuff

Let's get the no-brainers out of the way first. These are the things you'd pack for any overnight trip:

*   **Change of clothes:** You might be there longer than you think. Pack something comfortable.
*   **Toiletries:** Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, face wash. The basics to keep you from feeling (too) gross.
*   **Phone and charger:** Obvious. But make sure you have a portable charger too, because outlets are never where you need them.
*   **Wallet with ID and insurance card:** In case of emergencies or paperwork.

## Creature Comforts

Labor is long. Hospitals aren't exactly known for their luxury accommodations. Pack these to make yourself a little more comfortable:

*   **Snacks:** Hospital food is... hospital food. Pack some granola bars, trail mix, or whatever keeps you going.
*   **Water bottle:** Staying hydrated is important, even if you're not the one pushing a human out.
*   **Pillow and blanket:** Hospital pillows are thin and scratchy. Bring your own for a better chance of sleep (or at least a decent nap).
*   **Comfortable shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of pacing. Ditch the dress shoes and pack some sneakers or slip-ons.

## The "Dad MVP" Items

These are the things that will make you a hero during labor and delivery:

*   **Bluetooth speaker:** Create a calming (or hype!) playlist for the delivery room.
*   **Lavender essential oil:** Wave a little under her nose for calming.
*   **Massage oil:** If she wants a massage, you'll be ready.
*   **Her favorite snacks:** Because pregnancy cravings are real.
*   **A book or game:** For when things are slow. Labor can be hours of waiting.

## The Stuff Nobody Tells You

**You might feel useless.** She's doing all the hard work. You're just... there. That's OK. Your presence matters. Your support matters. Even if all you do is hold her hand and offer encouragement, you're doing great.

**It's going to be intense.** Labor is messy, loud, and emotional. Don't be afraid to ask questions or take a break if you need to.

**You're going to be a dad.** This is the moment it all becomes real. Get ready for the biggest adventure of your life.
