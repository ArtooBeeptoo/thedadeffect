She just told you. Maybe she showed you the test. Maybe she said the words. Maybe she's crying and you can't tell if it's happy tears or terrified tears or both.

Your brain is now running seventeen programs simultaneously. Joy. Panic. Math. So much math. You're calculating rent and diapers and college tuition before you've even hugged her back.

Take a breath. We're going to walk through this.

## The First 24 Hours

Here's what to do right now, today, in the next few hours:

**Hug her.** Before you say anything smart or funny or start googling nursery furniture. Just hold her. She's been sitting with this information — maybe for hours, maybe for days — trying to figure out how to tell you. Your first reaction matters more than you think.

**Don't immediately "fix" things.** Your instinct is going to be to start planning. Budgets. Timelines. Insurance. That's fine — later. Right now she doesn't need a project manager. She needs her partner.

**It's OK to be scared.** You don't have to perform excitement you don't feel. Honest reactions build trust. "I'm thrilled and terrified" is a perfectly acceptable thing to say. "Let me process this" is fine too. What's not fine: going silent, making it about you, or immediately bringing up money.

## The First Trimester: What's Actually Happening

Weeks 1-12. She might not look pregnant. She might not even feel pregnant at first. But inside? It's chaos.

**What she's dealing with:**
- Nausea that isn't limited to mornings (whoever named it "morning sickness" was a liar)
- Exhaustion like she's never experienced — growing a human is metabolically equivalent to climbing a mountain every day
- Hormones that make her emotions feel like a pinball machine — she's not being dramatic, her body is being rewritten
- Anxiety about everything: is it healthy, am I eating right, what if something goes wrong
- Possible food aversions that change daily — yesterday she loved chicken, today the smell makes her gag

**What you're dealing with:**
- Feeling useless because you can't fix any of the above
- Financial anxiety you're probably not talking about
- A weird identity shift happening in slow motion — you're becoming "a dad" and that's a lot
- Possible jealousy of the attention she's getting (it's OK to acknowledge this privately)
- The terrifying realization that you are now responsible for a human being

Both of these lists are valid. Both matter.

## How to Not Screw Up the First Trimester

**1. Learn the food rules.** No raw fish, no deli meat, no unpasteurized cheese, limited caffeine. Don't make her police her own diet — learn the list yourself so you can cook meals she can actually eat. Bonus: she'll love you for not making her explain why she can't have a turkey sandwich.

**2. Go to the appointments.** All of them. Not just the ultrasound where you get the cute picture. The boring ones too. The ones where they check her blood pressure and she pees in a cup. Be there. It tells her this is a team effort.

**3. Handle the logistics she can't think about right now.** Research insurance coverage. Look into parental leave policies at both your jobs. Start a shared note with questions for the doctor. She's too nauseous to think about deductibles.

**4. Don't announce it before she's ready.** This is her news to share on her timeline. Not yours. Not your mom's. If she wants to wait until 12 weeks, you wait until 12 weeks. Full stop.

**5. Physical touch might change.** Her body is doing weird things. Some days she wants to be held constantly. Some days being touched makes her skin crawl. Don't take it personally. Ask before you assume.

**6. Manage your own anxiety separately.** Find a friend, a brother, a therapist. Don't dump your fears on the person who is already carrying the physical burden. Process your stuff, but not at her expense.

## The Stuff Nobody Tells You

**You might not feel connected yet.** She's got a human growing inside her. You've got... an abstract concept. That's normal. The connection often doesn't hit dads until the first ultrasound, or the first kick, or sometimes not until the baby is actually in your arms. Don't feel guilty about this.

**She's going to say things she doesn't mean.** Hormones are real. She might snap at you over dishes, cry over a commercial, or tell you she hates the name you suggested with a fury that seems wildly disproportionate. Let it go. This isn't the hill.

**Your relationship is about to be stress-tested.** The couples who do well aren't the ones who never fight during pregnancy. They're the ones who keep talking. Keep checking in. Keep asking "what do you need right now?" even when the answer is "I don't know."

**You're going to be a great dad.** You know how I know? Because you're reading this. The guys who don't care don't google "how to support pregnant wife." You're already ahead.
