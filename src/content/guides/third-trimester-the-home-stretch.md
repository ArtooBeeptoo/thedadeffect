Welcome to the third trimester, weeks 28 through 40 (or 41, or 42 — babies don't read calendars). This is it. The final stretch. The part where pregnancy stops being a theoretical future event and becomes a "this is actually happening, possibly any day now" reality.

She's huge. She's uncomfortable. She can't sleep. She might be waddling. She's definitely over it.

And you? You're about to become someone's dad. Like, for real.

Let's get you ready.

## She's Running Out of Room (And Patience)

Here's what's happening inside her body right now: a full-sized baby is crammed into a space that was never designed for a full-sized baby. Every organ has been shoved somewhere else. Her lungs are compressed. Her bladder has the capacity of a thimble. Her stomach can hold approximately three bites of food before she feels like she's going to explode.

The symptoms of the third trimester are not subtle:

**She can't breathe.** The baby is literally pushing against her diaphragm. She might get winded walking across the room. This is normal. It's miserable, but it's normal.

**She can't sleep.** Between the heartburn, the hip pain, the constant need to pee, and the impossibility of finding a comfortable position when you're shaped like a beach ball, sleep becomes a series of frustrating naps. She's going to be exhausted. All the time. Forever.

**She can't eat.** Not because she doesn't want to — because there's no room. Her stomach is compressed to the size of a golf ball. She might need to eat tiny meals every two hours just to get enough calories. Keep snacks everywhere.

**Everything hurts.** Her back. Her hips. Her pelvis. Her feet. That thing called "lightning crotch" — sudden, stabbing pains in her pelvis from the baby pressing on nerves. Yeah. That's a thing. It's as fun as it sounds.

**Braxton Hicks contractions.** Her uterus is practicing for labor. These "practice contractions" feel like her belly tightening, sometimes for 30 seconds to a minute. They're usually painless but uncomfortable. They're not regular, and they stop if she moves or changes position. If they don't stop, and they're getting more intense and closer together — that's not practice anymore. That's the real thing.

Your job during these final weeks is simple: **make her life as easy as humanly possible.** 

She's doing the hard part. You're doing everything else.

## The Nesting Instinct Is Going to Hit Like a Truck

Somewhere around week 32 to 36, she's going to wake up one Saturday morning with a wild look in her eyes and announce that the closets need to be reorganized immediately and also the baseboards are unacceptable and why don't we have a changing table yet and we need to wash all the baby clothes RIGHT NOW.

This is nesting. It's biological. It's primal. And you cannot fight it.

The nesting instinct is her body's way of preparing for the baby — creating a safe, clean, organized space for this tiny human who is about to arrive. It's irrational, it's obsessive, and it's completely unstoppable.

Your job is to support the nesting without questioning it.

**Don't say:** "Do we really need to reorganize the pantry at 11 PM?"

**Do say:** "I'll start pulling everything out. Where's the label maker?"

Here's the thing about nesting: it's actually useful. All those tasks she's suddenly fixated on? They need to happen anyway. The nursery needs to be finished. The car seat needs to be installed. The hospital bag needs to be packed. The house needs to be reasonably clean before you bring a newborn into it.

So lean in. Help her check things off the list. Because once the baby comes, that list isn't getting touched for months.

## The Hospital Bag: Pack It Now

Do not wait until she's having contractions to throw random stuff in a duffel bag. Pack the hospital bag by week 36. Put it by the door. Forget about it until you need it.

**Her bag should have:**
- Comfortable going-home outfit (she'll still look 6 months pregnant after delivery — don't pack pre-pregnancy jeans)
- Nursing bra or comfortable bralette
- Toiletries — her own shampoo, toothbrush, face wash, chapstick
- Phone charger (long cord)
- Pillow from home (hospital pillows are sad)
- Robe and slippers
- Snacks (labor is a marathon and hospital food is... hospital food)
- Glasses/contacts if she wears them
- Hair ties
- Comfort items — music playlist, book, whatever helps her relax
- Outfit for the baby to wear home

**Your bag should have:**
- Change of clothes (you might be there for days)
- Phone charger
- Snacks (lots of snacks)
- Toothbrush
- Deodorant
- Cash for vending machines and parking
- A book or something to do during the waiting parts
- Pillow (that hospital chair-bed is not comfortable)
- Comfortable shoes

**Don't forget:**
- Car seat (installed and inspected — many fire stations will check it for free)
- ID and insurance cards
- Birth plan (if you have one)
- Camera or phone with storage space

The bag sits by the door. You don't touch it. You don't borrow the phone charger. It stays packed and ready because babies don't schedule their arrivals.

## The Birth Plan: Have One, But Hold It Loosely

A birth plan is a document that tells your medical team what you'd prefer during labor and delivery. Pain management preferences. Who's in the room. Music or no music. Immediate skin-to-skin contact. Delayed cord clamping. That kind of thing.

Here's the truth about birth plans: **they rarely go exactly as written, and that's okay.**

Labor is unpredictable. Babies are unpredictable. What sounds ideal at 36 weeks might not be possible or desirable when you're actually in the moment. She might be committed to an unmedicated birth and then twelve hours in, she's begging for the epidural. That's not failure. That's adapting.

The birth plan isn't a contract. It's a conversation starter with the medical team. It's a way of saying "here's what we're hoping for" while understanding that the goal is a healthy mom and a healthy baby, however that happens.

Your job is to know what's in the plan and to advocate for her when she can't advocate for herself. If she wanted delayed cord clamping but things are chaotic and nobody's mentioned it — you mention it. If she wanted to avoid an episiotomy unless medically necessary and nobody's explained why they're recommending one — you ask questions.

You're her voice when she's in the middle of the hardest physical experience of her life. Know the plan. But be flexible. And remind her that changing the plan isn't giving up — it's making the best decision with the information you have in the moment.

## The Classes: Take Them Seriously

If you haven't taken a childbirth class yet, you're running out of time. Most recommend completing them by week 36.

I know — you've watched YouTube videos, you read the books, you've got the general idea. Contractions, pushing, baby comes out. How hard can it be?

**Take the class anyway.**

Here's why: a good childbirth class teaches you what to expect at each stage of labor, how to support her through contractions, what all the medical interventions are and when they're used, and — critically — what's normal versus what's a problem. You will be less scared if you know what's happening. She will be less scared if you're not scared.

You'll also learn comfort techniques that actually work. How to apply counter-pressure on her back. How to help her change positions. Breathing exercises that sound cheesy until she's actually using them.

Many hospitals offer free or cheap classes. There are also excellent online options — Kopa Birth, The Positive Birth Company, and others. Find one that matches your birth philosophy (medicated vs. unmedicated, hospital vs. birth center, etc.) and actually pay attention.

Also worth considering:
- **Breastfeeding class** — yes, for both of you. You need to understand how it works so you can support her when it's hard (and it's often hard at first)
- **Infant CPR** — this should be mandatory for every parent. Learn it before the baby comes
- **Newborn care class** — diapering, bathing, swaddling, safe sleep. Some of this is intuitive. Some of it really isn't

## The Appointments: Now They're Weekly

In the third trimester, prenatal appointments shift from monthly to biweekly, then to weekly in the final stretch. They're checking:

- Blood pressure (watching for preeclampsia)
- Baby's position (head down is what we're hoping for)
- Baby's heart rate
- Fundal height (measuring the belly to track growth)
- Cervical changes as you get closer (dilation, effacement)

These appointments are short but important. Go to them. Especially in the final weeks when things can change quickly.

Around week 36, they'll do a Group B Strep test — a vaginal/rectal swab checking for a bacteria that's harmless to adults but can be dangerous to newborns during delivery. If she tests positive, she'll get IV antibiotics during labor. It's routine and nothing to worry about.

They'll also start checking the baby's position more seriously. You want head-down (called "vertex"). If the baby is breech (feet or butt first) at 36 weeks, they might offer an external cephalic version (ECV) — a procedure where the doctor manually tries to turn the baby from the outside. It's uncomfortable, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. If the baby stays breech, you're likely looking at a C-section.

## The Countdown: What's Happening Each Week

Here's a rough timeline of the final stretch:

**Weeks 28-32:** Baby is getting bigger and stronger. Movements are more pronounced. She's getting more uncomfortable but still mobile.

**Weeks 32-36:** Baby is putting on fat, lungs are maturing. Braxton Hicks may increase. Nesting kicks into high gear. This is when you should have the hospital bag packed and the car seat installed.

**Weeks 36-37:** Full term is approaching. Baby could come anytime after 37 weeks and be considered "early term." Appointments are weekly now.

**Weeks 38-40:** Full term. The baby is ready. Now you wait. Everything is uncomfortable. Time moves slowly. Every twinge is "is this it?"

**Week 40+:** The due date is a guess, not a deadline. Only about 5% of babies arrive on their actual due date. If she goes past 40 weeks, the provider will start talking about induction timing. Most practices don't let you go past 41-42 weeks.

## The Waiting Game: How to Survive the Final Weeks

The last few weeks of pregnancy are a special kind of torture. The due date looms. Everyone is texting "any news yet??" She's exhausted and enormous and ready to be done. And all you can do is wait.

Here's how to survive:

**Stop asking "how are you feeling?"** She feels huge, tired, and over it. You don't need to keep checking. She'll tell you if something changes.

**Protect her from other people.** Relatives, friends, coworkers — everyone wants updates. Appoint yourself the gatekeeper. "We'll let you know when there's news" on repeat. She shouldn't have to manage other people's excitement right now.

**Have distractions ready.** Binge-worthy shows. Easy projects. Board games. Anything to make the waiting feel less excruciating.

**Batch cook and freeze meals.** You will not want to cook when you have a newborn. Spend a weekend making soups, casseroles, and anything that can be reheated one-handed at 3 AM. Future you will be so grateful.

**Sleep.** Both of you. Sleep is about to become a precious, rare commodity. Bank as much as you can now.

**Don't go too far.** She could go into labor any time after 37 weeks. Don't plan a weekend trip. Don't schedule anything that can't be cancelled. Stay close. Be ready.

**Have the logistics figured out.** How are you getting to the hospital? What's the fastest route? Where do you park? Is there a separate entrance for labor and delivery? Know this stuff so you're not googling it during contractions.

## The Signs of Labor: Know What to Look For

Real labor is coming. Here's how you'll know:

**Bloody show.** A small amount of blood-tinged mucus. It means her cervix is changing. Labor could be hours away or days away. It's a sign things are moving.

**Water breaking.** The movies make this look like a dramatic gush. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it's a slow trickle and she's not sure if she peed. If she thinks her water broke, call the provider. Once the water breaks, labor usually needs to happen within 24 hours to reduce infection risk.

**Contractions that don't stop.** Unlike Braxton Hicks, real contractions get longer, stronger, and closer together over time. They don't stop when she moves or changes position. Time them — how long each one lasts and how far apart they are.

**The 5-1-1 rule.** For first-time moms, the general guideline is to head to the hospital when contractions are 5 minutes apart, lasting 1 minute each, for at least 1 hour. (This can vary — follow your provider's specific instructions.)

When in doubt, call the provider. That's what they're there for. Better to call and be told it's not time yet than to wait too long.

## What Nobody Tells Dads About the Third Trimester

**You're going to feel helpless.** There's nothing you can do to speed this up, fix her discomfort, or make the baby come. All you can do is be present, be patient, and be supportive. That's enough. It doesn't feel like enough, but it is.

**The fear is real.** You're about to be responsible for a human life. You're about to watch your partner go through something intense. It's okay to be scared. Most dads are. You don't have to pretend you're not.

**Your relationship is about to change.** Not in a bad way — but in a fundamental way. You're going from partners to parents. The dynamic shifts. Make space for each other during these final weeks. Have the hard conversations if you need to. Say the things you want to say before the chaos starts.

**You're ready.** Even if you don't feel ready. Even if the nursery isn't perfect. Even if you still can't fold a fitted sheet or install a car seat on the first try. You're ready because you care enough to be reading this. You're showing up. That's the whole job.

## The Finish Line

The third trimester ends with a beginning. Soon, she'll be in labor. Soon, you'll be holding your baby for the first time. Soon, everything changes.

These final weeks are uncomfortable and interminable and full of waiting. But they're also the last weeks of just the two of you. The last weeks before you meet the person you made together.

Soak it in. Help her. Rest up. And get ready.

You've got this, dad.
