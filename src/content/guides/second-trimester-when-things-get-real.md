Welcome to the second trimester, man. Weeks 13 through 27. The part of pregnancy that people actually call "the good part" — which, if you survived the first trimester's nausea-fest and emotional whiplash, sounds almost too good to be true.

Spoiler: it mostly is the good part. But "good" is relative when you're building a human from scratch.

She's starting to show. The nausea is (probably) fading. And somewhere around week 18 to 20, you're going to feel your baby kick for the first time and have a moment where your brain finally catches up to what's been happening inside her body for months.

Let's talk about what's coming and how to not blow it.

## She's Going to Get Her Energy Back (Use It Wisely)

The first trimester was survival mode. She was exhausted, nauseous, and probably surviving on crackers and sheer willpower. The second trimester often brings a wave of energy that feels almost suspicious after what she just went through.

This is sometimes called the "honeymoon trimester," and here's why:

- **The nausea usually eases up.** Not for everyone — some women get morning sickness that lasts the entire pregnancy, because life is unfair. But for many, the constant low-grade misery lifts somewhere around week 14-16.
- **Energy returns.** She might actually want to do things again. Go places. Eat meals that aren't plain toast. This is great.
- **Her mood may stabilize.** The hormone rollercoaster from the first trimester settles down a bit. Note: "settles down" does not mean "disappears." Adjust expectations accordingly.

Here's the thing, though — just because she feels better doesn't mean she's back to pre-pregnancy normal. She's still growing a human. Her body is still doing insane things. Don't mistake "feeling better" for "totally fine and doesn't need help anymore."

Keep showing up. Keep doing the dishes. Keep asking what she needs.

## The Bump Is Real Now

Somewhere in the second trimester, her belly goes from "did she eat a big lunch?" to "oh, she's definitely pregnant." This is a big deal for both of you, but for very different reasons.

**For her:** It's exciting and terrifying. Exciting because she finally looks pregnant and strangers stop wondering. Terrifying because her body is changing in ways she can't control, her clothes don't fit, and she's watching herself transform into someone she doesn't fully recognize yet.

**For you:** It's the moment this whole thing stops being abstract. You've known she's pregnant for weeks, but seeing the bump grow makes it real in a way that two pink lines on a test never did.

Here's your job during the bump era:

**1. Tell her she looks amazing.** Not in a "wow, you're so brave" way. Not in a patronizing way. In a genuine "you look incredible and I'm attracted to you" way. Because society is going to spend the next several months making her feel like her body is public property, and you need to be the voice that reminds her she's beautiful. Mean it.

**2. Don't comment on her size.** Not "you're so big!" Not "you're barely showing!" Not "are you sure it's not twins?" Nothing. The only acceptable bump comment from you is "you look great." Full stop. Trust me on this.

**3. Help with the wardrobe situation.** Her regular clothes are getting tight and maternity clothes feel like admitting defeat. This is a weirdly emotional transition. If she needs new clothes, support that. If she wants to wear your oversized t-shirts for three months, support that too.

## The Anatomy Scan: The Appointment You Don't Want to Miss

Around week 20, you'll have the anatomy scan — the big ultrasound. This is different from the early ultrasound where you squinted at a grainy blob and pretended to see a baby. This time, you're going to see an actual tiny human on that screen.

They're checking everything: brain, heart, spine, kidneys, limbs, face. The tech is going to measure bones and organs and blood flow. It takes a while — usually 30 to 45 minutes — and it's simultaneously the coolest and most nerve-wracking appointment of the entire pregnancy.

A few things to know going in:

**The tech might go quiet.** Don't panic. They're concentrating. They're measuring. They're trying to get your baby to cooperate, which — surprise — babies are already stubborn in the womb. Your kid might be facing the wrong way, curled up in a ball, or straight-up refusing to show the tech what they need to see. Some couples have to come back for a second scan because the baby wouldn't cooperate. It happens.

**You might find out the sex.** If you want to know, this is usually when they can tell you. If you don't want to know, tell the tech before they start. Make sure you and your partner are on the same page about this ahead of time. Finding out in the moment because one of you accidentally asked is... not ideal.

**It might not go perfectly.** Most anatomy scans come back totally fine. But sometimes they flag something — a soft marker, a measurement that's a little off, something that needs a follow-up. If this happens, try not to spiral. Many flagged findings turn out to be nothing. Ask the doctor to explain what they're seeing and what it means. Get the information before you get on Google.

**Be present.** Put your phone away. Watch the screen. Ask questions. This is one of those moments you're going to remember. The first time you see your baby's face on a screen — actual features, not a blur — is something else.

## The Kicks: When Your Baby Becomes a Person

Sometime between weeks 18 and 25, she's going to feel the baby move. At first it's subtle — women describe it as fluttering, like butterflies, or even like popcorn popping. It's easy to miss or mistake for gas (glamorous, I know).

Then the kicks get stronger. And eventually, you can feel them too.

Here's what nobody prepares you for: **the first time you feel your baby kick through her belly, something shifts in your brain.** For months, this has been her experience. She's the one who's pregnant. She's the one whose body is changing. You've been supportive, sure, but there's a distance — an abstraction — that you can't quite bridge.

Then you put your hand on her belly and feel a tiny foot push against your palm, and suddenly this isn't abstract anymore. That's your kid in there. Moving. Alive. Responding to the world.

It's going to wreck you. In the best way.

**Pro tip:** Babies tend to be more active after she eats or when she lies down. If you want to catch a kick, have her snack on something and then lie on the couch together. Put your hand on her belly and wait. Be patient — babies are not performers and they will absolutely stop moving the second you put your hand there, just to mess with you.

Also: talk to the bump. Read to it. Play music. By week 23 or so, the baby can hear sounds from outside the womb. Your voice is becoming familiar to someone who hasn't even been born yet. That's wild.

## The Stuff She's Dealing With (That She Might Not Tell You)

The second trimester isn't all glowing skin and renewed energy. There's a highlight reel of new symptoms that nobody puts on the pregnancy announcement:

**Round ligament pain.** Sharp, stabbing pains in her lower belly or groin when she moves too quickly. It's her uterus expanding and pulling on the ligaments that support it. It's harmless but it hurts, and it can scare the hell out of both of you the first time it happens.

**Back pain.** Her center of gravity is shifting. Her body is carrying extra weight in a place it's never carried weight before. Her back is going to protest. Offer to rub it without being asked. Actually — just start doing this regularly. You will earn points you didn't know existed.

**Heartburn from hell.** The baby is pushing her organs around and the hormone progesterone is relaxing the valve between her stomach and esophagus. She might feel like she swallowed a torch after eating a single cracker. Keep Tums in stock. Everywhere. Nightstand, car, purse, kitchen counter.

**Leg cramps.** Usually at night, usually in her calves, usually at 3 AM when you're both finally asleep. Nobody fully understands why pregnancy causes leg cramps, but they're common and they're miserable. If she wakes up gasping, help her flex her foot — pull her toes toward her shin. It helps.

**Pelvic girdle pain (SPD/PGP).** The baby's weight plus pregnancy hormones can cause pain in her pelvis, hips, and sometimes down her thighs. This can range from mildly annoying to genuinely debilitating. If she's having pelvic pain, encourage her to mention it to her provider early — a pregnancy physiotherapist can make a huge difference.

**Skin changes.** The "linea nigra" — a dark line that appears down the center of her belly. Possible darkening of her face (melasma). Stretch marks. Her skin is doing things it's never done before and she might feel weird about it. Refer back to rule #1: tell her she looks amazing.

**Anxiety that hasn't gone away.** Just because the miscarriage risk dropped doesn't mean the worry stops. Now she's worried about the anatomy scan, about the baby's development, about labor, about whether she'll be a good mom. The fears just evolve. Keep checking in.

## How to Keep Being Useful

You got through the first trimester. Great. Here's your second trimester playbook:

**Go to the anatomy scan.** Non-negotiable. This is the Super Bowl of prenatal appointments. Be there.

**Start thinking about the nursery.** You don't need to finish it yet, but this is a good time to start planning. She's going to start nesting — that instinct to prepare the space — and having a partner who's engaged in the process matters. Paint colors, crib research, furniture layout. Get involved before she does it all herself and then resents you for not helping.

**Take a childbirth class.** Yeah, I know. It sounds corny. Some of them are corny. But knowing what to expect during labor — the stages, the timing, the interventions, your role — is going to make the actual day significantly less terrifying. Do it now while you have the energy and the calendar space. By the third trimester you'll be too busy assembling flat-pack furniture.

**Handle the baby registry.** This is either fun or overwhelming depending on your personality. Either way, start researching car seats, strollers, and cribs now. Read reviews. Ask friends with kids what they actually used versus what collected dust. She's going to have opinions and so will the internet — your job is to help narrow it down so she's not drowning in choices.

**Keep going to appointments.** They're every four weeks in the second trimester. They feel routine. Go anyway. This is you being a teammate. Also, you'll hear the heartbeat on the Doppler and it's going to make your whole week every single time.

**Plan something for just the two of you.** Date night, babymoon, weekend trip — whatever your budget allows. Your time as a duo is running out. Not in a sad way, but in a real way. Prioritize each other now. Once the baby arrives, alone time becomes a precious commodity.

## The Stuff Nobody Tells Dads About the Second Trimester

**You might start nesting too.** The urge to fix things, organize the garage, build shelves, make the house "ready" — that's not random productivity. That's your version of nesting. It's biological. Go with it. Just don't start a bathroom renovation at 24 weeks.

**Your sex life might bounce back.** With the nausea gone and energy returning, many couples find the second trimester is when intimacy picks back up. (For the record: sex during pregnancy is safe unless her doctor has specifically said otherwise. You are not going to hurt the baby. The baby has no idea what's happening. Relax.) But also — she might not be interested, and that's equally normal. Follow her lead.

**You might start feeling left out.** Everyone asks how she's doing. Nobody asks how you're doing. Her body is visibly changing; yours isn't. She's bonding with the baby physically; you're bonding abstractly. It's easy to feel like a supporting character in someone else's story. That feeling is normal and valid, but don't let it fester. Talk to someone — a friend, a therapist, your partner. You're allowed to have feelings about becoming a dad.

**The financial reality is setting in.** You've probably started looking at daycare costs and experienced what I call "the daycare heart attack." Deep breaths. People have been affording babies since the dawn of time, and many of them had way less than you. Make a plan, start a budget, and stop googling "cost of raising a child to 18" at midnight. That number is designed to terrify you.

**You're going to feel more connected to this baby.** The kicks, the anatomy scan, the bump getting bigger — the second trimester is when many dads go from "I'm going to be a father" to "I'm already a father." It's a slow shift, and it doesn't happen all at once, but by the end of these 14 weeks, you're going to feel it.

## What's Coming Next

The third trimester. The home stretch. Hospital bags, birth plans, and the nesting instinct cranked to eleven. It's going to be intense — but you've made it this far, and you're more ready than you think.

For now, enjoy the second trimester. Feel the kicks. Watch the bump grow. Take the classes. Go to the appointments. Tell her she's beautiful. Talk to your baby.

You're doing this, man. And you're doing it well.
