Welcome to parenthood — where every day is an adventure and you might get peed on at any moment. Changing that first diaper? It’s like riding a bike: except the bike is your baby, and the seat is a surprise mess that just might make you question all your life choices. 

## What to Expect 
Get ready for a sensory overload. You’re likely to encounter everything from explosive blowouts to tranquil yellow mustard (note: not actual mustard). Here’s the lowdown on what to have handy before you dive in:
- **Supplies:** Get yourself a clean diaper, wipes, a changing pad (or just a clean, soft surface), and maybe a plastic bag for the used diaper.
- **Bapa's Safe Space:** If possible, keep your little one safe on a stable surface. No one wants a mini escape artist doing the diaper dance on a changing table.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. The Setup
- Place your baby on the changing table or a flat surface.  
- **Tip:** Talk or sing to your baby to keep them comfortable. They might enjoy hearing your off-tune rendition of their favorite song more than you think.

### 2. Diaper Off
- Unfasten the dirty diaper's tabs, but don’t remove it just yet. Push down the front of the diaper with one hand while simultaneously lifting the baby’s legs with the other. This prevents any surprise fountains!

### 3. Clean Up
- Use wipes to clean the area gently. Front to back for girls — this is **very** important to avoid UTIs! For boys, keep a cloth handy in case of unexpected sprays.

### 4. Diaper On
- Slide the fresh diaper under the baby. Make sure the back is higher than the front (you don’t want leaks!).
- Pull the front up between the legs and secure the tabs to the sides. Make sure it’s snug but not too tight. You don’t want your parenting debut to include a Monty Python sketch about blood circulation.

### 5. Dispose of the Dirty Diaper
- Roll the dirty diaper up and fasten it securely with the tabs. Toss it in the plastic bag or your diaper pail. 
- **Bonus Tip:** If you’re outside the home, hold your breath and pray for a fast escape.

### 6. Wash Your Hands
- Congratulations! You’ve just changed a diaper. Now go wash your hands — and maybe treat yourself to some hand sanitizer while you’re at it.
