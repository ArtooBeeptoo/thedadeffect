So, your partner has been gripped by cravings more intense than your late-night pizza binges, and you’re standing in the aisle of the grocery store, utterly bewildered. One day it's pickles, the next it's ice cream, and then suddenly, she can’t stand the smell of the perfectly seasoned chicken you grilled last week. What gives?

**Welcome to the beautiful chaos that is pregnancy cravings and aversions!** Here’s the scoop on what to expect, practical tips for your journey through the culinary desert, and some real talk about feelings in the mix.

## 1. Understanding Cravings
Cravings during pregnancy are real and often completely bizarre. According to multiple studies, one-third to half of expecting mothers report food cravings,** ranging from sweet treats to savory snacks. Some might even find themselves craving chalk or dirt (yes, that’s a thing called pica).* So, understanding these cravings is step one.

### Why Do They Happen?
- **Hormonal changes.** Hormones like progesterone and estrogen can influence taste and smell, leading to unexpected desires for foods you never thought she liked.
- **Nutritional needs.** Sometimes, cravings can signal that she’s lacking certain nutrients. That’s right; those pickles might mean her body is craving sodium!
- **Psychological factors.** Pregnancy is a rollercoaster ride, and sometimes she might just want to eat what she craved as a child.

## 2. Handling Aversions
Food aversions are equally common, and they can be a challenge. Suddenly, she might want to hurl at the thought of chicken, broccoli, or even her favorite breakfast cereal.

### Why Aversions Occur
- **Hormons again!** Pregnancy can heighten smell sensitivity, making certain foods unpalatable.
- **Previous negative experiences.** If she had a bout of morning sickness after eating something certain, that food may forever have a bad association.

## 3. Your Role as the Cook
As the designated chef (or at least co-chef), your mission is to keep the kitchen a safe haven — as best as you can, at least!

### Quick Tips
- **Be flexible.** If she suddenly loses her taste for tacos, get creative with what what you can whip up. Salads? Pasta? Go with the flow!
- **Cook together.** Involve her in the cooking process. If she’s craving a simple pasta, it’s a great opportunity to make it together and add her favorite bits.
- **Game plan.** If she has specific cravings, make sure to have those ingredients on hand at all times. Foods like fruits, cheeses, and even snacks she enjoys can be lifesavers.
- **Respect her aversions.** If she cannot stand the thought of grilled chicken today, don’t take it personally! It’s not about you, it’s biology at work.

## 4. Managing Your Own Stress
While you’re busy catering to her needs, don’t forget your feelings. This might become overwhelming! It’s okay to feel confused, irritated, or even a bit out of control. Find your outlet — talk to other dads, friends, or a therapist if you need to.
