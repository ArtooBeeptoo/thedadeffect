You just made her a perfectly normal sandwich. Turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato. You know, food.

She takes one bite and puts it down. "I can't eat this. The turkey smells like... like death."

Welcome to the wild world of pregnancy cravings and aversions. Where yesterday's favorite food becomes today's enemy and midnight pickle runs are more important than sleep.

Your brain is probably doing one of three things:
1. Panic mode (WHAT DO I FEED HER?!)
2. Scientist mode (Let me research this on 17 different websites)
3. Sergeant mode (SOLDIER UP! EAT THE SANDWICH!)

Relax. We're going to walk through this.

## The First Rule: There Are No Rules

One day she'll crave chocolate cake with pickles. The next day she'll gag at the sight of water. The day after that? She might only eat orange food.

There's no logic here. There's no "she's craving X because her body needs Y" (mostly). This is hormone roulette and you're playing with a loaded chamber.

**What you need to know:**
- 50-90% of pregnant women have cravings or aversions (or both)
- They can start as early as week 1 and last the whole pregnancy
- They can change from hour to hour
- This is normal. This is fine. This is temporary (mostly)

## The Most Common Cravings (And How to Handle Them)

**1. The Sweet Tooth**
Ice cream, cookies, cake, chocolate — the sugar monster is real.

*Why you might panic:* "She's eating garbage! The baby will have diabetes!"

*The reality:* She's not eating a pint of ice cream with every meal (probably). She's probably having a scoop after dinner. That's fine.

*Your move:* Keep a variety of sweet options around. Fruit when she wants something "healthy," ice cream when she wants "real" dessert, and don't police it. If she wants chocolate cake at 9 PM, you go get chocolate cake at 9 PM.

**2. The Salty Crunch**
Chips, pretzels, french fries, pickles. Suddenly everything needs salt.

*Why you might panic:* "She's going to retain water and swell up like a balloon!"

*The reality:* Salt cravings are super common. Sometimes it's just about taste. Sometimes it's about electrolytes. Either way, it's probably fine in moderation.

*Your move:* Stock the pantry with different salty options. Make air fryer fries (they're faster and less greasy). Buy different kinds of pickles (sweet, dill, bread-and-butter — she might want different ones on different days). Pro tip: Keep a jar of pickles in the bedroom. Midnight pickle runs are a thing.

**3. The Dairy Obsession**
Milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream — suddenly dairy is life.

*Why you might panic:* "She's lactose intolerant but wants cheese pizza?!"

*The reality:* Sometimes this is about calcium. Sometimes it's about texture. Sometimes it's about comfort food. Don't overthink it.

*Your move:* Have yogurt in the fridge, cheese sticks in the drawer, and milk at the ready. If she wants a cheese board at 10 PM, you assemble a cheese board at 10 PM. Bonus points if you include grapes and crackers.

**4. The Weird Combinations**
Hot Cheetos dipped in yogurt. Pickles on peanut butter toast. Spaghetti with chocolate sauce. The brain-mouth connection has been rewired.

*Why you might panic:* "This is not food. This is a crime against cuisine."

*The reality:* Her taste buds are on drugs. Hormones have completely rewired her brain's relationship with food. What sounds disgusting to you might be perfection to her right now.

*Your move:* Don't judge. Don't ask questions. Just make it happen. If she wants sauerkraut on her peanut butter sandwich, you put sauerkraut on her peanut butter sandwich. You don't have to eat it. You just have to not make her feel crazy for wanting it.

**5. The "I Only Want X" Phase**
Sometimes she'll only want one specific thing for days. Only pizza. Only tacos. Only cereal.

*Why you might panic:* "We're having pizza for the third night in a row! What about vegetables?!"

*The reality:* When you're nauseous and everything else sounds disgusting, sometimes one safe food is all you can handle. It's better than eating nothing.

*Your move:* If she can only eat pizza for three days, you bring pizza. Try to sneak in a side salad or veggie sticks, but if they get rejected, don't push it. Survival mode, not nutrition mode.

## The Most Common Aversions (And How to Survive Them)

**1. The Meat Rejection**
Suddenly the smell of cooking meat makes her want to vomit. Even chicken. Even bacon. Even the steak she used to love.

*Why you might panic:* "But we need protein! The baby needs protein!"

*The reality:* She's not rejecting protein, she's rejecting the SMELL of cooking meat. Which is different. And very real.

*Your move:* 
- Take over cooking meat if you can (do it when she's not home)
- Cook meat with windows open and fans on
- Focus on other protein sources: beans, tofu, eggs, nuts, dairy
- Make smoothies with protein powder
- If she can't handle any meat, don't force it. She'll eat what she can

**2. The Vegetable Hate**
Broccoli, spinach, carrots — all the healthy stuff suddenly tastes like dirt.

*Why you might panic:* "She's not eating vegetables! The baby will have scurvy!"

*The reality:* Taste buds change. What was once sweet and delicious might now taste bitter and disgusting.

*Your move:*
- Hide veggies in things: smoothies, soups, casseroles
- Try different cooking methods: roasted veggies might be better than raw
- Focus on fruits (they're still healthy!)
- Give it time — often aversions change

**3. The Water Aversion**
She can't drink water. It makes her gag. But she's pregnant and needs to stay hydrated.

*Why you might panic:* "Dehydration! Preterm labor! This is an emergency!"

*The reality:* Many pregnant women develop water aversions. It's weird but common.

*Your move:*
- Try different beverages: coconut water, lemon water, herbal teas
- Offer water with lots of ice (sometimes the cold helps)
- Try flavored waters (no artificial sweeteners)
- Eat high-water foods: watermelon, cucumber, strawberries
- Pedialyte or electrolyte drinks if she's really struggling

**4. The Kitchen Smoke Alarm**
Any cooking that produces smoke or strong smells might trigger nausea.

*Why you might panic:* "But we have to eat! We can't live on takeout!"

*The reality:* Your kitchen might become a no-go zone when you're cooking. It's fine.

*Your move:*
- Cook when she's not home
- Use the exhaust fan religiously
- Open windows and use fans
- Opt for cold meals when possible
- Embrace the slow cooker (less smell)
- Have some healthy takeout options on speed dial

## Your Kitchen Survival Kit

Every pregnant-kitchen needs these things:

**The Pantry Staples:**
- Multiple types of crackers (saltines, graham, plain)
- Pickles (all kinds)
- Cereal (several varieties)
- Yogurt (plain and flavored)
- Fruit cups
- Applesauce
- Nuts and trail mix
- Granola bars

**The Fridge Essentials:**
- Cold cuts (if she can eat them)
- Cheese sticks and blocks
- Yogurt
- Hard-boiled eggs (if she can eat eggs)
- Pre-cut fruit
- Veggies with dip
- Leftovers from when she could eat them

**The Emergency Supplies:**
- Ginger ale or ginger chews
- Peppermint tea
- Lemon water
- Crackers by the bed
- A "pregnancy emergency" snack stash in the car

## When You're the Chef

When she lets you cook (bless her heart), follow these rules:

**1. Ask Before You Cook**
"What sounds good?" is your most important question. Don't just make what you want.

**2. Have Backups**
If she takes one bite of what you made and rejects it, have plan B ready. You always need a backup.

**3. Embrace the Slow Cooker**
Set it and forget it. Minimal smell, maximum food. This is your secret weapon.

**4. Learn to Make 5 Things She'll Always Eat**
Pasta, tacos, sandwiches, smoothies, and something you can order as takeout. Master these.

**5. Don't Take It Personally**
When she rejects your lovingly cooked meal, it's not about you. It's about her nose suddenly deciding that chicken smells like dirty socks.

## The Midnight Snack Run

This is your initiation into dadhood. The 10 PM grocery run for pickles and ice cream is a rite of passage.

**Your Midnight Snack Run Protocol:**
- Don't complain
- Don't ask why (you don't want to know)
- Get exactly what she asks for
- Don't judge the combinations
- Come back with a smile
- Don't wake the neighbors

## When to Panic (And When Not To)

**Call the doctor if:**
- She's craving non-food items (dirt, chalk, paint, etc.) — this could be pica
- She can't keep anything down for more than 24 hours
- She's losing significant weight
- She's completely unable to drink fluids

**Don't panic if:**
- She only wants to eat one food for a few days
- Her cravings seem weird or random
- She changes her mind about food every hour
- She rejects your cooking (it's not you, it's the hormones)

## The Most Important Rule

You are not her nutritionist. You are not her food police. You are not the food police.

Your job is not to ensure she's getting perfect nutrition every day. Your job is to make sure she's eating something. Anything.

Some days it will be nachos for breakfast, cake for lunch, and pizza for dinner. Other days it might be just toast and crackers.

This is fine. The baby will be fine. She will be fine. You will be fine.

## What About Your Cravings?

Surprise! Sometimes dads get pregnancy cravings too. It's called Couvade syndrome — when you experience sympathetic symptoms.

You might find yourself suddenly hating foods she hates or craving foods she craves. It's weird but normal.

## The Light at the End of the Tunnel

Most cravings and aversions:
- Start around week 4-5
- Peak in the second trimester
- Start to fade by the third trimester
- Completely disappear after the baby is born

There's an end date. I promise.
